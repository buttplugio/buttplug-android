Buttplug is a framework for hooking up hardware to interfaces, where
hardware usually means sex toys, but could honestly be just about
anything. It's basically a userland HID manager for things that may
not specifically be HID.

In more concrete terms, think of Buttplug as something like
[osculator](http://www.osculator.net/) or [VRPN](http://vrpn.org), but
for sex toys. Instead of wiimotes and control surfaces, we interface
with vibrators, electrostim equipment, fucking machines, and other
hardware that can communicate with computers.

The core of buttplug works as a router. It is an application that
connects to driver libraries, to register and communicate with
different hardware. Clients can then connect over different means
(network, websockets, etc...), to interact with the hardware.

## Other Buttplug Implementations

Buttplug implementations are available in multiple languages (c#, rust,
javascript, etc)/frameworks/platforms. For a full
list,
[see the README in the main buttplug repo](http://github.com/metafetish/buttplug).

## Platform Support

Buttplug Java should run on any 1.7 or later JRE (including Android).
In depth testing is still pending, so your mileage may vary.
